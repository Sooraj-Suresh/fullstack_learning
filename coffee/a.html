            Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee plant is a bush
            or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut shorter. Coffee plants
            originally grew in Africa, and now also grow in South America, Central America and Southeast Asia. They are
            an important crop for the economies of many countries.

            The first branded coffee to be sold commercially to the public was Nescafé in 1879. The drink is made from
            the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and is a popular drink in
            many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug that keeps people awake.

            To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the beans and then
            roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked. This preserves them and makes them ready
            to be packed or roasted. Before the beans are made into a drink, they must be roasted or ground (crushed
            into tiny pieces in a coffee mill). When the ground coffee is placed into boiling water, the flavour and
            dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water. Making coffee is called brewing coffee. There are
            several different ways that coffee can be brewed.

            Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin, niacin, magnesium, potassium, and
            various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants.</p>

        <p><b><u class="fs-3" >When people drink coffee</u></b><br><br>

            A coffee shop in France
            The United States buys the most coffee; Germany is next. People in Finland drink the most coffee for each person. In Canada, the United States and Europe, some restaurants sell mainly coffee; they are referred to as "cafés" or "coffeehouses". Cafés often sell food, but the type of food is different from one country to another.
            
            In some countries, for example, those in northern Europe, people like having coffee parties. At these parties, people have coffee and cake.
            
            In many countries, people drink coffee at work; in the United States and England, for example, people drink it in the morning. In other countries, such as Mexico, people drink it in the evening to help them stay awake.</p>
